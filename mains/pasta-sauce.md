# Pasta Sauce

## Ingredients

* Olive oil
* 2 large onions, finely diced or pureed
* 4 stalk celery, finely diced or pureed
* 15 cloves garlic, finely diced or pureed
* 1 large can tomato paste \(13 oz, 369ml\)
* 4 large cans \(28 oz, 796ml\) tomatoes: whole, diced or crushed depending how chunky you want the sauce. 
* 3 Tbsp fennel seeds
* 8 Tbsp dried oregano
* Optional: 1 Tbsp dried thyme
* Optional: Lots of parsley
* Optional: Some basil
* Optional: 1 cup of red wine

## Steps

In large pot:

1. Gently sauté onions, celery, garlic in a lot of olive oil until well done, not brown \(takes a while\)
2. Add tomato paste, mix well, cook a couple of minutes
3. Add all tomato products, water to top of pot, add herbs, mix well
4. Sauté gently till olive oil forms black skin on top -- stir from bottom regularly.  Takes a while.  It will tend to stick and scorch.  Reduce more if too thin.
5. When done, taste for salt and adjust.
