# Saucy chicken and arugula meatballs

## Ingredients

### Meatballs

* olive oil
* 3 thin slices pancetta or bacon \(about 2 oz\), chopped
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 large bunch arugula \(about 6 oz\), stemmed and finely chopped
* 1 lb ground chicken or turkey
* 1/2 cup + 2 Tbsp plain bread crumbs
* 1/2 cup freshly grated pecorino-romano cheese \(about 1 1/2 oz\)
* 2 Tbsp drained capers, chopped
* 1 large egg, lightly beaten
* salt and pepper

### Sauce

* 3 Tbsp unsalted butter
* 2 large shallots, minced
* 1/4 cup cognac or brandy
* 1 35 oz can of italian tomatoes with juice, coarsely chopped \(e.g. in food processor\)
* 1 tsp fresh thyme, freshly chopped
* salt + pepper

## Steps

### Make the meatballs

* Heat oil; add pancetta and cook over moderate heat until crisp, about 3 min; Add garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 1 min; Add arugula and cook, stirring, until wilter, 1-2 min; Transfer to a plate and let cool
* In a large bowl, combine ground chicken, bread crumbs, cheese, capers, egg, 3/4 tsp salt and 1/8 tsp pepper.  Add arugula mixture and beat until well blended. Roll the mixture by teaspoonfuls into 3/4 inch balls
* In large skillet, heat 1/4 inch of olive oil. Add half of the meatballs and cook over moderate heat, turning, until browned all over, about 3 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer meatballs to a large plate.  Discard the fat and wipe out the skillet.

### Make the sauce

* In the same skillet, melt the butter over moderate heat. Add the shallots and cook until softened, about 3 minutes.  Add the cognac, raise the heat to high and cook until evaporated. Add the tomatoes and the thyme and season with salt and pepper.  Bring to a simmer and cook until the sauce is thick, about 8 minutes.

Make ahead: the meatballs and sauce can be refrigerated separately for up to a day. Return both to room temp before continuing.

Add the meatballs to the sauce and simmer over low heat just until heated through, about 3 minutes.
