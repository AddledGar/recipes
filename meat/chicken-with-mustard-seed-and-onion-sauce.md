# Chicken with mustard seed and onion sauce

Ingredients

* 5 tbsp vegetable oil
* 2 tbsp yellow mustard seeds
* 1 onion, thinly sliced
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 1/2 tsp minced fresh ginger
* 1 tsp turmeric
* 1/2 tsp honey
* 1/8 tsp cayenne
* 1 c chicken stock or low-sodium chicken broth
* 1/2 c crème fraîche or heavy cream
* Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
* 4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
* All purpose flour for dredging
* 1 tbsp chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley or cilantro

Steps

1. In a medium saucepan, warm 2 tbsp oil over moderate heat. Add the mustard seed and cover the pan. When the seeds begin to pop, remove the pan from the heat and wait until the popping has stopped, about 30 seconds.  Uncover the pan; the seeds will be dark gray.
2. Return the pan to the heat and add the onion.  Cook over moderate heat stirring until softened but not browned, about 5 minutes.  Add the garlic, ginger, turmeric, honey and cayenne and cook, stirring, until fragramn, about 3m.  Add the chicken stock and boil over high heat until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Add the crème fraîche and cook over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, until the sauce lightly coats the back of a spoon, about 4 minutes.  Season the sauce with kosher salt and black pepper.
3. Remove the tender from each piece of chicken.  Cut the chicken breasts in half crosswise and lightly pound all pieces to an even thickness.  Season them with salt and black pepper, then dredge lightly in flour, shaking off the excess.
4. In a large skillet, heat the remaining 3 tbsp of oil. Add the chicken in batches and brown.
5. Then figure it out on your self because the recipe ends here. ;-\)
