# Maryam's Persian Kabobs

## Ingredients: 

* 350 grams ground beef \(15% fat\) 
* 1/4 teaspoon salt 
* 1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper 
* 1/8 teaspoon turmeric powder 
* Pinch of saffron powder \(optional\) 
* 1 large onion peeled and 
* finely chopped 1 teaspoon olive oil 

## Steps

1. In a warm mixing bowl, combine meat and the rest of the kabob ingredients listed above. Knead with your hands for a few minutes \(not much more than a few minutes; otherwise, the kebobs will become too firm\) 
2. Using damp hands, divide the meat into 7 equal lumps about the size of small oranges. Then, roll each into a kebob shape \(about 8 cm long, 2 cm wide, and 1 cm deep\). You can also roll them into the shape of small burgers if youâ€™d prefer \(e.g., about 7 cm in diameter and 1 cm deep\). 
3. Pour 3 tablespoons of cooking oil into a non-stick medium size pan, and then place in the kebobs \(or small burgers\) and fry both sides on **medium heat**.
