1. Make the spice mixture by stirring together the spices in a small bowl.  Preheat oven to 350F
2. In a large ovenproof stew pot or tagine, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Season the lamb all over with salt and pepper.  Add the meat to the pot and stire to coat in the oil.  Brown for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally to make sure the meat browns evenly on all sides.  Transfer the meat to a bowl and set aside
3. Lower teh heat to medium and add the onion, stirring to coat.  Saut√© for about a minute, until it begins to soften.  Add the garlic and ginger and add the meat back to the pot.  Stir everything togetehr.  Squeeze the orange juice into the pot and mix well.  Add the tomatoes, orange peel, spice mixture, chicken broth and honey.  Mix well.
