# Roasted chicken provencal

Ingredients

* 8 chicken thighs, skin on \(or 4 quarters\)
* 2 tsp kosher salt
* 1 tsp fresh ground pepper
* 1/2-3/4 c flour
* 3 tbsp olive oil
* 2 tbsp herbes de Provence
* 1 lemon, quartered
* 8-10 garlic cloves, peeled
* 4-6 medium shallots, peeled and halved
* 1/3 c dry vermouth
* 4 sprigs of thyme for garnish

Steps

1. Preheat oven to 400ÂºF. Season the chicken with salt and pepper.  Put the flour in a shallow pan and dredge the chicken through it, shaking the excess flour.  
2. Swirl the oil in a large roasting pan and place the floured chicken in it.  Season the chicken with the herbes de Provence. Arrange the lemons, garlic cloves, and shallots around the chicken, and then add the vermouth to the pan.
3. Put the pan in the oven, and roast 25-30 minutes, then baste with the pan juices. Continue roasting for an additional 25-30 minutes or until the chicken is very crisp and the meat cooked through.
4. Serve in the pan or in a warmed platter, with thyme as garnish
