# Chicken Ragout Jeanette

Ingredients

* 1 tbsp canola or safflower oil
* 4 whole chicken legs \(about 2.5 lbs\), skinned and patted dry
* Salt and freshly ground pepper
* 1 4 oz piece of lean salt pork or bacon, cut into 1/2" wide strips
* 1 medium bunch of scallions, coarsely chopped
* 1 medium onion, coarsely chopped
* 2 tsp flour
* 1/2 c dry white wine
* 2 large garlic cloves, crushed
* 1/2 tsp thyme
* 2 bay leaves
* 1 lb medium red potatoes, halved
* 1/4 tsp Tabasco \(optional\)
* 2 tbsp coarsly chopped flat leaf parsley

Steps

1. Heat the oil in a large heavy non-reactive skillet.  Add the chicken legs, seasons with salt and pepper, saut√© over moderately high heat, turning occasionally, until browned on both sides, about 8 minutes.  Transfer to a plate.
2. Meanwhile, if using salt pork, put the strisp in a saucepan with 2 c of water. Boil for 1 minute then drain and rinse with cold water.
3. Add the salt pork or bacon to the drippings in the skillet and cover partially to prevent splattering. Cook over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally until browned and crisp, about 6 minutes.  Add the scallions and onions, mix well, and cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until just beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in the flour and continue browning the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 1 minute longer.
4. Add 1 1/4 c of water and the wine to skillet, and bring to a boil over moderate heat, using a wooden spoon to scrape up any brown bits.  Stir in the garlic, thyme, bay leaves and 1/2 tsp salt.  Add the potatoes and chicken legs and bring back to a boil.  Cover and cook over low heat until the potatoes are tender and the chicken is almost falling off the bones, about 30m.  Stir in the Tabasco sauce.
5. Discard the bay leaves, sprinkle the ragout with parsley and serve at once.
