# Braised chicken legs with olives and tomatoes

Ingredients

* 1/4 c plus 2 tbsp olive oil
* 4 whole chicken legs
* salt and pepper
* 1 medium onion, finely chopped
* 4 garlic cloves, crushed
* 1 28 oz can peeled whole tomatoes, drained and coarsely chopped
* 1/3 c dry white wine
* 1 tbsp finely chopped rosemary
* 1 c Calamata or other black olives, pitted

Steps

1. In a large heavy skillet, heat 2 tbsp of oil until almost smoking.  Season the chicken legs with salt and pepper, and cook over moderately high heat until well browned, about 5 minutes per side.  Remove the chicken from the pan and pour off the fat.
2. Heat 2 more tbsp of oil in the skillet. Add onion and 3 of the garlic cloves and cook over moderately high heat, stirring, until softened, about 7 minutes.
3. Add the chicken to the skillet with the tomatoes, wine, and rosemary; season with pepper and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until the chicken is cooked through, 20-25 minutes. Season with salt. Trasnfer the chicken to a plate and keep warm.
4. Meanwhile, in a food processor, pulse the olives with the remaining 2 tbsp of oil and 1 garlic clove to a coarse paste.  Stir the olive paste into the pan sauce and warm over moderate heat. Spoon the sauce over the chicken and serve.
