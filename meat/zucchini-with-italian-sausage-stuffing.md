# Zucchini with italian sausage stuffing

Ingredients

* 4 zucchini, about 1 1/4 lb total
* 1 Tbsp olive oil
* 1/2 small onion, minced
* 1 garlic clove, minced
* 1/3 cup peeled, seeded and diced tomato
* 1 tsp minced fresh marjoram
* Salt and pepper
* 3 oz fresh pork sausage with fennel
* 1/2 cup soft fresh breadcrumbs
* 1 egg, lightly beaten
* 2 Tbsp freshly grated parmesan cheese

Steps

* Half the zucchini lengthwise; using melon baller, scoop out flesh, leaving walls that are just thick enough to hold a filling.  Chop the zucchini flesh medium fine
* Heat the olive oil in skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and saute until soft. Add the garlic and saute for 1 minute to release fragrance
* Add the chopped zucchini, tomato, marjoram and salt and pepper. Cook for 3 minutes to soften the zucchini.  Remove from heat and stir in sausage, crumbling it with a fork.  Transfer to a bowl and stir in breadcrumbs, egg and cheese.
* Preheat oven to 350 F.
* Arrange zucchini shells in a slightly oiled baking dish.  Fill cavities with the stuffing, mounding it in the shells.  Bake uncovered until the zucchini are tender, 40-45 minutes.  Serve hot.

Serves 4.
