# Oven braised chicken thighs in tomato and yogurt curry

Ingredients

* 3 lbs boneless chicken thighs trimmed of fat
* 2 1/2 cups stirred yogurt \(don't use non-fat\)
* 3 c pureed tomatoes
* 1 tbsp plus 1 tsp salt
* 1/2 tbsp ground cayenne pepper
* 2 tbsp ground corianter
* 3 tbsp ground cumin
* 1 tbsp plus 1 tsp paprika
* 2 1/2 tbsp finely chopped fresh ginger
* 1 tbsp celery seed
* 10 cloves
* Black cardamom seeds from 3 to 4 pods
* 1 oz \(7 large\) garlic cloves, finely chopped
* 1/2 c canola oil
* 2 c water

Steps

1. preheat oven to 375ยบ F
2. Break open the cardamom pods and remove the seeds.  The best seeds are dark brown and stuck together.  If they are light brown and dry, they won't have much flavor so try using new pods.  We sometimes have to go through 6-10 pods to get the moist seeds from four.  Discard the pods, set aside the seeds.
3. In a medium to large size cassoulet or other baking dish, mix the yogurt, tomatoes, salt, cayenne pepper, coriander, cumin, paprika, ginger, celery seed, cloves, black cardamom, garlic and oil with the chicken thighs. Add water, mix well, cover \(use foil if you don't have a lid\) and bake for approx. 40m.  To check doneness, poke a thigh with a knife to test doneness.
4. Keep covered until you are ready to serve
