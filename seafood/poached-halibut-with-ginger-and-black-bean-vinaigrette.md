# Poached halibut with ginger and black bean vinaigrette

### Ingredients

* 2 medium cloves garlic, minced
* 1 Tbsp fresh ginger, minced
* 1/2 c pickled ginger \(kind served with sushi\),  \(150g jar\)
* 3 Tbsp pickled ginger juice from the container
* 2 Tbsp apple cider vinegar
* 3/4 tsp sea salt
* 3 Tbsp sugar
* 1/4 c fermented black bean
* 3/4 c vegetable oil
* 6 6-oz fresh halibut filets
* 2 Tbsp vegetable oil

### Steps

1. Make the vinaigrette at least a day ahead.  Combine all ingredients except oil in a food processor or blender, and pulse until very finely chopped.  With motor running, add oil in a slow stream and process until well blended.  Cover and refrigerate.
2. Preheat oven to 400F.  IN a heavy frying pan, heat 2 Tbsp veg. oil on high heat.  Season the halibut filets  with salt and pepper and cook in hot oil for about 3-4 minutes, until bottom is browned.  Flip and place the pan in the oven.  Cook the fish until just opaque, about 8 minutes. Place fish on heated plates and spoon sauce over the filets.
