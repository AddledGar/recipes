# Peperoni alla piemontese \(anchovy-stuffed peppers\)

### Ingredients

* 3 red or golden bell peppers
* 1 1/2 c peeled, seeded and finely diced plum tomatoes \(about 3 lg\)
* 4-8 anchovy fillets, minced
* 2 large garlic cloves, minced
* 1/3 c fine dry bread crumbs
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* salt and freshly ground pepper
* 1 tbsp butter

### Steps

1. Preheat oven to 375F
2. Cut the peppers into quarters lengthwise, remove stems, seeds and ribs.
3. Combine tomatoes, anchovies, garlic, breadcrumbs, and olive oil.  Blend well.  Season with salt and pepper.
4. Place pepper wedges in an oiled baking dish.  Fill wedges with stuffing; dot with butter. Cover and bake until peppers are tender, about 45 minutes, then uncover and bake for 15 minutes to reduce pan juices. Serve warm. Serves 6 as an antipasto.
