# Maryam's Persian rice

## Ingredients

* 2 cups long-grain Basmati Rice
* 1 tablespoon salt \(a bit less if more potent sea salt is used\) 

## Steps

1. Put rice in a bowl and wash 2 times using lukewarm water.
2. Add salt and 3 cups of lukewarm water to the rice and leave to soak for at least 30 minutes; this soaking step is important for developing a better taste and also for the rice to cook faster \(OK to let the rice soak in the salty water longer, even overnight\).
3. Boil 6 cups of water in a medium size pot
4. Drain away the salty water in which rice has been soaking and then add the soaked rice to the boiling water that is bubbling at the surface \(i.e., water that has come to a full boil\)
5. After about 6-8 minutes, check the rice; if the grains have grown longer and the rice is semi-soft \(but not completely soft yet\), drain away the boiling water.
6. At this time, it’s a good idea to taste a few grains of the rice and if it’s too salty wash the rice with warm water.
7. While the rice is cooling a bit, spread the bottom of a small size nonstick pot with 3 tablespoons of cooking oil and add a pinch of saffron \(can also add some sesame seeds if you’d like\). Also, add one tablespoon of water and mix. Then, put the rice in the pot and give it a pyramid shape for better cooking.
8. Using a long spoon, create two or three holes that run to the bottom of the rice pyramid. Then, place a firm lid on the pot.
9. Cook for 25 minutes using low heat.
10. Turn off the heat, remove the lid, and place rice in round big plate for serving.
