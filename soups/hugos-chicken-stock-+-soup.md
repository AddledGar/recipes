Cut carrots, celery, leeks, parsnip, turnip, garlic, onion into halves to maximize surface area. The amount of different vegetable can be modified: Parsnips give a peppery taste, turnips a meaty taste, etc...\)

Brown vegetables in oven on braise. Some burning is acceptable, but they should retain their moisture.

Brown chicken parts in a steel pot - this takes a long time. The chicken parts should be cooked for as long as possible without burning, can take as long as 5-10 min a side. The more fonde created the better the stock.

In stock pot combine browned chicken, vegetable, a generous handful of pepper kernels \(optionally tasted in a pan\) the Bouquet Garni. Fill to rim with water.

Bring to a low simmer and cook for at least 10hrs, adding water to when necessary.

Strain through a chinois or through cheesecloth placed in a colander. Through out the remains.

Let the stock cool to room temp. Skim fat and refrigerate. The stock remain fresh for at least 5 days. Bring the stock to a boil and it can last another 5 days \(Optionally leave the fat to form a film on the surface - this will result in a more muddy taste, but the stock will last longer, up to 10 days.\)
