# Mjadra aka Mujaddara

## Ingredients

* 1 c brown or green lentils
* 1 1/2 cups uncooked white basmati rice
* 5 cups \(2-3 large\) onions, thinly sliced into half moons
* 1/4 cup water
* 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
* 1 tsp cumin seeds
* 1 2 inch cinnamon stick
* 1/4 tsp ground allspice
* 2 tsp sea salt
* 2 1/2 cups water

## Steps

Soak the lentils in water while you are preparing the rest of the ingredients. Remaining ingredients.

Place the onions in large frying pan. Add a quarter cup water and bring to simmer over medium heat. Cook, stirring often until the onions are soft, translucent and reduced in volume. Continue cooking onions in the water until the liquid has evaporated. Add the olive oil and continue cooking, stirring often until the onions are deep brown 15 to twenty minutes. Drain off the oil, pressing down through a sieve over the pot that you will be cooking the rice and the lentils in. Save the onions.

Drain the lentils and place them in a medium pot. Fill with enough cold water to cover the lentils by a few inches. Bring to simmer. Cook until just tender but still firm, anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes depending on the dryness of the lentils. Drain the lentils, discarding the water. Save the lentils.

Heat oil oil over medium heat and add the cumin seeds. Wen they turn a shade darker add the rice, cinnamon stick and allspice. Cook and stir for a minute until the rice is glistening with oil. Add the lentils, three quarters of onions, salt and water. Bring to boil, cover with a tight fitting lid, and turn too low. Cook for 25 to 30 minutes until the water has evaporated. Remove the lid and gently stir to distribute the lentils and rice. Cover and cook 15 minutes longer. Remove from heat and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Turn out onto a serving dish and garnish with the remaining fried onions.
