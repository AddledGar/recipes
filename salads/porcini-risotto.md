# Porcini Risotto

### Ingredients

* 2 dried porcini mushrooms \(15g\)
* 1 c dry white wine
* 6 c hot chicken stock or bouillon
* 1/4 c diced onions
* 2 garlic cloves minced
* 1 1/2 c Arborio rice
* 1/4 Parmesan cheese

### Steps

1. Rinse mushrooms well.  Place in pan with wine and stock and bring to a boil.  Cover and set aside until cooled.
2. Remove mushrooms with slotted spoon and finely chop.  Strain juices through cheesecloth to remove residue.  Set juices aside and keep warm.
3. Saut√© onions and garlic in butter in a large pot until softened.  Stir in rice until coated with pan juices.  Stir in warm mushroom water and cook rice, uncovered stirring often until rice has absorbed liquid.  
4. Continue adding hot stock 1/2 c at a time until it is all absorbed in the rice about 30m.  Grains should still be slightly firm once all liquid is added but not dry. Stir in mushroom bits and cheese and heat through.  Serve 6-8
