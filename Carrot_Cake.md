# Carrot cake

* 2 cups of flour
* 1 and ½ cups of cassonade
* 2 teaspoons baking soda (bicarbonate de soude) (or 3x that for baking powder)
* 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
* ½ teaspoon salt

Mix the above

add:

* 1 & ¼ cup of peanut oil (arachide)
* 3 eggs, one at a time

mix, adding progressively

* 2 cups grated carrots
* 1 cup raisins sec 
* 1 cup walnuts (cut up in a mixer)

put in oven at 175 degrees Celcius

If it has been put into a single pan, check at about 40 min
and when nothing sticks to the cake tester in the thickest part of the cake,
it should be done.

(the timing will depend upon the form of the cake pan).
