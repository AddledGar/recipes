# Roast Tomato with Pasta

Tomatoes - the selection of tomatoes is the most important part of this dish. The tomatoes need to both very ripe, and also a variety of tomatoes that have a relatively low water content. The tomatoes should be ripe enough to be easy to peel, the skin loose on the meat. Ripe San Marzano are good, otherwise heirloom tomatoes or other local varieties work best. Large scale tomato farms over-water tomatoes before picking, so buy local and/or small scale to avoid that.

Preheat over to 180C \(?\)

Optionally skinning tomatoes, halve them and remove seeds and as much of the high water content parts as possible, leaving only the dense flesh.

Place tomatoes in a baking pan with raised edges, packing the pan to form a solid layer 1/2 - 3/4 inch thick

Drizzle with olive oil and roast until all juices have evaporated. Stir if necessary to avoid excess browning or char of flesh, and remove just before juices burn.

In a pan, cook diced garlic with a dash of olive oil until garlic releases it's aroma. Add roasted tomatoes and stir vigorously to break up the tomatoes forming a rough paste. The only liquid should be oil \(some oil can be drained if preferred\) Cook until tomatoes fall apart, no more than 7 mins

Serve over pasta, optionally add Parmesan/pepper

If cooked properly the sauce should have a sweet taste - almost fruity. The olive oil provides most of the moisture for the pasta, with minimal garlic.
