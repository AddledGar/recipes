1. Combine the butter and olive oil in a large heavy saucepan set over medium heat.  When hot, add the onions, celery, and carrots, season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring frequently, until the vegetables start to brighten in color, about 20 minutes.
2. Add the garlic and just before it starts to brown, add the beef and pancetta.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until the meat is throughly browned, about 25 minutes.  Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 5 minutes.  Add the milk, and cook at a lively simmer until the milk is absorbed, 10-15 minutes.  Add the wine and simmer until the pan is almost dry. Stir in the tomatoes and the stock, scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.  Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 3 hours, stirring occasionally.  Skim the fat off the surface.  
3. Toss with al dente rotini or pappadelle and serve with parmesan.  Serves 6.
