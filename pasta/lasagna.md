## Meat Sauce

For meat, used mixture of \(veal or beef\) and pork

For tomatoes, uses San Marzano or organic

* 2 796mL cans of tomatoes
* 1/4 olive oil
* 2 oz pancetta, chopped
* 2 c chopped onions and 1/2 cup finely chopped carrots and 1/2 c celery, pureed in food processor
* 2 tsp chopped fresh garlic
* 1/4 c chopped italian parsley
* 1 lb ground beef or veal
* 1 lb ground pork
* salt and freshly ground pepper
* 1/2 white wine
* 1 c beef stock
* 2 Tbsp tomato paste

1. Chop tomatoes and reserve \(don't need the juice\)
2. Heat oil in dutch oven or equivalent over med-low heat.  Add pancetta and sauté for 1 minute. Add onions, carrot and celery \(aka mirepoix\) and cook gently until vegetables are very soft and begin to brown \(at least 10m, could be more\).  Stir in garlic and parsley and cook for 3 minutes more.
3. Increase heat to medium. Add meats, stirring to break up clumps of meat.  Sauté until meat loses its pinkness, about 5 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Degrease if needed.
4. Add wine and boil until wine is mostly evaporated and mixture is saucy, about 4 minutes.  Stir in stock, tomato paste and reserved tomatoes.  Bring to boil, reduce heat to low and cook till dry.  Simmer for 1/2 h then remove the lid and turn the heat up to medium low.  Sauce should be thick and _very tasty_.
5. Simmer gently for a few minutes if it is too think.  Reseason if needed.  Makes about 9c of sauce.
