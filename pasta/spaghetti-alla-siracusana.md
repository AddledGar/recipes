# Spaghetti alla Siracusana

### Ingredients

* 3/4 lb spaghetti
* 1/2 c olive oil
* 1 c fresh bread crumbs
* 1/2 c freshly grated pecorino
* 1 3.75 oz can oil packed sardines, drained
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* 2 tbsp tomato paste dissolved in 1/4 c water

### Steps

1. Fill a large pot with water, cover and bring to a boil. Add salt and the spaghetti.  Cover partially until the water just returns to a boil, then uncover, stir the spaghetti and cook until al dente.  Drain and transfer to a warmed, large serving boil, cover and keep warm.
2. Meanwhile, in a large skillet, heat 1/4 c olive oil. Add the bread crumbs and cook over moderately high heat stirring constantly, until golden and crisp, about 4 minutes.  Transfer to a bowl and stir in the cheese.
3. Wipe out the skillet. Add the remaining 1/4 c olive oil, the sardines and the garlic and cook over moderate heat, stirring, until the sardines begin to break up, about 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and stir in the dissolved tomato paste.  Pour the sauce over the spaghetti and toss.  Season with pepper adn stir in 3 tbsp of the bread crumbs.  Sprinkle half of the the remaining bread crumbs on top and serve.  Pass the remaining bread crumbs at the table.
