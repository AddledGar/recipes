# Spaghetti with garlic, olive oil and tomato paste

### Ingredients

* 1/4 c EVOO
* 2 tbsp tomato paste
* 1 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic
* kosher salt
* 1/2 lb imported dried spaghetti or spaghettini
* 2 tbsp chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
* 1 tbsp finely shredded fresh basil
* Finely julienned scallions for garnish \(optional\)

### Steps

1. Fill a stockpot with 6 qts of water, cover and bring to a boil.
2. In a nonreactive skillet large enough to hold the pasta, combine EVOO, tomato paste, garlic and 1 tsp salt.  Cook over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until the garlic is golden, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat.
3. Add 3 1/2 tbsp kosher salt to the water and add the spaghetti. Cover partially until the water just returns to a boil, then uncover, stir the pasta and cook until al dente
4. Drain the spaghetti and add it to the skillet and toss well.  Add the parsley and basil and toss again.  Transfer to plates, garnish with scallions and serve immediately
