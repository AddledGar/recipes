### Steps

1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Add noodles and cook until barely tender, about 5 minutes.  They should retain a hint of chewiness.  Drain, rinse with cold water, drain again and toss with a splash of sesame oil.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the remaining ingredients except cucumbers and peanuts.
3. Pour the sauce over the noodles and toss.  Transfer to a serving bowl, and garnish with cucumber and peanuts.  Serves 4.
