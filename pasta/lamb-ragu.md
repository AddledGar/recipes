# Lamb Ragù

## Ingredients

* 1 large onion, chopped
* 2 carrots, chopped
* 3 celery stalks, chopped
* 4 cloves garlic, chopped
* EVOO
* Salt
* 3 lbs ground lamb leg or shoulder
* 1 cup tomato paste
* 3 cups hearty red wine
* 2 Tbsp chopped fresh rosemary
* 3 bay leaves
* 1 bunch thyme tied in a bundle
* Pepper
* Pici, bucatini or pappardelle
* Grated Parmesan

## Steps

1. Using a food processor, purée the onion, carrots, celery and garlic to a coarse paste
2. Coat a large pan generously with olive oil and set over medium heat. Add the puréed vegetables, season with salt and cook until all teh water has evaporated and the vegetables begin to brown, 15 to 20 minutes.  Stir frequently and be patient \(this is where the big flavors develop\)
3. Add the lamb, season generously with salt and cook until it is browned, about 25 to 30 minutes.  \(Brown food tastes good; don't rush this step\)
4. Add the tomato paste and cook for about 5 minutes. Stir in the red wine, rosemary, and bay leaves.  Cook at a lively simmer until the wine has reduced by half.  Add the thyme bundle and enough water to cover the lamb by about an inch.  Simmer for 3-4 hours, stirring and tasting frequently and adding more water as it evaporates.  Skim the fat off the surface.  Remove the bay leaves and thyme.  Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
5. Toss with al dente pasta and serve with grated Parmesan
